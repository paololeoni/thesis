The "iso" script runs the radiative model for the vertical isothermal case. 
The "dart" script runs the radiative model for a vertical temperature gradient case. In particular we used Dartois et al. [2003] formulation.
Each script runs for 3 values of the ionization rate, 3 values of the disk mass and 1 value of the characteristic radius that has to be specified on the json file.
